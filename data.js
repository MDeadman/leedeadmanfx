var aboutText = `I am a special effects artist based in Toronto, ON. 
I graduated with honors from Sheridan College's Advanced Special Effects Makeup, Prosthetics and Props program in 2016. 
After graduating from the college's Visual and Creative Arts program in 2015
I first decided I wanted to create and bring characters to life through cosplaying, creating and wearing costumes of 
characters from popular media, where I discovered a love for costuming and propmaking. `;
